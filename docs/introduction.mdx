## Contrax Summary

Contrax is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) web application that allows anyone to enter a farms in a few clicks. You can enter and exit farms with just ETH after a simple sign-up process, with all reward tokens auto-compounding your position providing you a higher APY than all other users of that farm.
This app lowers the barrier of entry to DeFi by ensuring an easy onboarding experience, and ensuring any farms offered have been vetted for you by our DeFi experts.
