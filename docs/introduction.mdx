## Contrax Summary

Contrax is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) web application that allows users to farm real yield assets, and have them compound automatically. Users can also create tokens and pools in just a few clicks.
Our goal is to lower the barrier of entry to DeFi by ensuring an easy onboarding experience, and only listing farms with rewards from real revenue instead of token inflation.

Contrax is currently Arbitrum exclusive, but will expand to other chains after our beta phase.

## Getting Started

The pages here are in order to walk you through setting up everything you need to farm on Contrax: setting up MetaMask with Arbtrium, adding ETH to your wallet on Arbitrum, and then obtaining and staking the LP tokens for the farms.
We made the process as beginner-friendly. Each page should take only a few minutes to complete.
