## Overview

Contrax uses Ramp, a licensed and regulated third party service, to let you buy Ethereum on Arbitrum for Contrax farming. Per money exchange guidelines, you will have to provide identity information to Ramp, which Contrax cannot see or access at all.

## How to Buy

1. Make sure you connect/create your wallet by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner of the page. See [Wallet set-up](../start/wallet-setup) for more details.

2. Once connected, click "Exchange" from the sidebar, and you should see the Ramp widget. Enter your desired amount to purchase. You will see the ETH you will recieve after fees upfront.
