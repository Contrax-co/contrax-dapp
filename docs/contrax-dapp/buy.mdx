## Overview

Contrax uses Ramp, a licensed and regulated third party service, to let you buy Ethereum on Arbitrum for Contrax farming. Per money exchange guidelines, you will have to provide identity information to Ramp, which Contrax cannot see or access at all.

## How to Buy

1. Make sure you connect/create your wallet by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner of the page. See [Wallet set-up](../start/wallet-setup) for more details.

2. Once connected, click "Exchange" from the sidebar, and you should see the Ramp widget. Enter your desired amount to purchase. You will see the ETH you will recieve after fees upfront.

3. Enter an email address, and then provide the verification code sent to you.

4. Your wallet address should auto-fill if you are already connected. If it isn't, follow the [wallet set-up](../start/wallet-setup) instruction to connect and copy your wallet.

5. Pick a payment method. You may only have card available (this is up to Ramp), and provide the payment details.

7. For first time purchasers, you will need to verify your identity. This will include a photo of your ID and a selfie.
   Note that Contrax will never see your ID or other information, as Ramp is a third party service regulated to handle this data.

8. Select the ID type and follow the instructions. Be patient if it takes a few tries. You only need to do this once.

9. Follow the instructions for providing a selfie.

10. If everything is successful, you will see the approval screen. It can take a few minutes to a few hours to see your crypto in your wallet.
    You can check your dashboard periodically to see if your ETH has arrived.

## How to Sell

When you want to withdraw, you can use the same widget to sell, and follow the prompts.
You will not need to provide ID to sell after you already did for buying, so the process will be fairly straightforward.
