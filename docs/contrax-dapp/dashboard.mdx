## Overview

This is the dashboard which gives you an overview of your positions. Currently, it displays the autocompounding vaults that you have joined.

## Vaults breakdown

Each vault tile will provide the following information:

1. Liquidity: The TVL (total locked value) in the vault. This is the total size of the liquidity pool on Contrax.
2. Pool Share: the percentage of the vault that is yours.
3. APY: The growth rate of your position over a year. If you have a $100 in the vault with an APY of 30%, you can expect to have $130 in a year, assuming the token price remains the same.
4. Your Stake: The USD value of your stake.
