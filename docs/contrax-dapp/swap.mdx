This page is only for if a user wants to enter a single sided token they do not currently have, such as USDC, USDT, and GMX.

## Swap

1. Ensure you have Arbitrum ETH or another token supported by exchange.
2. Type you can type in the amount you want to swap (like 0.01 in the exmaple).
3. Once your amount auto-fills, click "See Details" and the following screen will show:
    <Frame>![Swap Details](/images/swap_details.png)</Frame>
4. If you are satisfied with the swap and USD values, click "Accept." You will then have to approve the swap in your wallet.
5. After a few seconds, you'll see a "Success" message. Click "Close" if you want to do another swap.

_You can now join a farm with the token. Head over the Farms page, which you can learn how to use [here](../contrax-dapp/farms)._
