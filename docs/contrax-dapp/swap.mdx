Note: Most users do not need to swap, unless you need to swap other tokens into USDC or ETH to use Contrax.

## Swap

1. Ensure you have Arbitrum ETH or another token supported by exchange.
2. Type you can type in the amount you want to swap (like 0.01 in the exmaple).
3. Once your amount auto-fills, click "See Details" and the following screen will show:
    <Frame>![Swap Details](/images/swap_details.png)</Frame>
4. If you are satisfied with the swap and USD values, click "Accept." You will then have to approve the swap in your wallet.
5. After a few seconds, you'll see a "Success" message. Click "Close" if you want to do another swap.

_You can now join a vault with the token. Head over the Earn page, which you can learn how to use [here](../contrax-dapp/farms)._
