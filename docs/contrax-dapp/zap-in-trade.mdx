## Overview

This tool lets you swap tokens. The exchange is a DEX that is connected to Sushiswap, and additionally, it allows for you to swap from regular tokens into the LP tokens needed for the farms, and viceversa when you want to cash out.

## Swap Tool

The top amount is the token amount that you have and want to to exchange. You can
see how much you have in USD and token amount on the right side (in the example:
$74.94 in ETH, or 0.0584... Ether)

The bottom amount will auto-fill with how much you will receive. Note the USD value on the side is _what you already have_ and not what you will recieve. In the example, we are swapping into the WETH-USDC LP token. LP tokens represent your share of the pool, so they will extremely tiny fraction token-wise (hence why it 6.17e-7).

The "See Details" button will show you exactly what you are swapping, what you will recieve, and the USD value for both (which, in a fair swap, should be about the same)

## How to Swap

1. Ensure you have Arbitrum ETH or another of the assets supported by exchange.
2. If you are in ETH, you can type in the amount you want to swap (like 0.05 in the exmaple), or click the "ETH" text and select the token you have.
3. Once your amount auto-fills, click "See Details" and the following screen will show:

4. If you are satisfied with the swap and USD values, click "confirm swap"
5. MetaMask wil pop up. Scroll down and confirm the transaction:

6. After a few seconds, you'll see a swapped confirmation from Contrax and MetaMask, as well as the updated values of your swapped assets, in this case, ETH and WETH-USDC:

_You are now ready to join a farm. Head over the Farms page, which you can learn how to use [here](../contrax-dapp/farms)._
