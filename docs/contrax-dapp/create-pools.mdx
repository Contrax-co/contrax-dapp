## Overview

_Disclaimer:_ This is the most expirmental feature of the beta, so please only use it to help us test it.

This tool allows you to a liquidity pool for your own tokens on Arbitrum. At current, you can select any token in your wallet and create a pool with USDC, USDT, DAI or WETH.

Although at current you can select any token in your wallet, recommend that you **should not** select any asset except your own created token.
You should also do your own research on how much of an existing asset you should provide against your own token. The amount of liquidity you provide will affect the price of your token.

_Important Note: If you cannot see your list of tokens, please wait until it loads. You can see when the list loads by checking if your tokens available on the create pools page._

## Pool Deployment Tool

<Frame>![Dashboard](/images/create_pool.png)</Frame>

In order to deploy a pool on Arbitrum, just do the following:

1. Select your custom token
2. Select an existing token, and ensure you have a balance for that token in your wallet.
3. Enter the token amount you want to deploy into the pool for both tokens
4. Click "Create a Pool" and confirm the transactions in your wallet.

Once it succeeds, you will get a success message. Your pool will show up in your pools list in a matter of minutes, but the actual link will not work until Sushiswap updates their list of pools, which can take over a day.
