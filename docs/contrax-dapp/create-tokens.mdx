## Overview

This tool allows you to create your ERC-20 tokens on Arbitrum. The created token will have its entire supply in your wallet after creation. You can then create a liquidity pool for it for others to trade for your token on Sushiswap from the Create Pool page.

There is no fee to use the token creator except the expected gas fee of Arbitrum, which varies, but will likely be around $1 worth of ETH.

## Token Creator Tool

1. Token Symbol: The shorthand for your token Like "ETH" is the symbol for Ethereum.
2. Total Supply: The number of tokens you want to create.
3. Token Name: The full name of your token. Like "Ether" is the name of the token.
4. Decimals: The number of decimals your token will have (ex: The US dollar has two. In $1.12, there's two decimal places allowed). Tokens normally have 18
5. Burn: Set a percentage of tokens to be burned whenever transferred. This will reduce the supply of your token by the percentage you set. For example, if you set it to 10%, if 100 tokens are transferred, then 10 tokens will be burned and the supply will be reduced to 90.
6. Trading Fees: Set a percentage of each transfer to be sent to the address you created the token with. For example, if you set it to 10%, any transaction must sent 10% of the tokens being transferred to your address.
7. Support Suppy Increase: If checked, the token creator will allow you to increase the supply of your token in the future.

## Token list

Under the token creator, Contrax shows you a list of all your ERC-20 tokens, including your self-created tokens.

**Important Note**: After you create your token, it may take a few minutes for it show on this list, because of the time it takes for the token to be verified, and the data to be added to the API which gets the list.
