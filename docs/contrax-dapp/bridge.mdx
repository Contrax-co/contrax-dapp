## Overview

Bridging lets you move ETH from mainnet Ethereum to Arbitrum or vice versa. Note that you do _not_ need this guide if you [buying ETH from Ramp](../contrax-dapp/buy) or [transferring from most platforms](../transfer/general), since they will give you the option to withdraw to Arbitrum.

## How to Bridge from Mainnet Ethereum to Arbitrum

1. Make sure you connect/create your wallet by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner of the page. See [Wallet set-up](../start/wallet-setup) for more details.

2. Once connected, change your network "Ethereum" in the top right corner if it isn't already.

3. Enter your Ethereum ETH amount, click "Review quote," and "confirm bridge." You may need to pay a few dollars in gas fees.

4. After waiting about five minutes, your ETH should have moved to Arbitrum. You can confirm this by again switching networks in the top right corner to "Arbitrum One," and seeing your balance on the dashboard.

## How to Bridge from Arbitrum to Mainnet Ethereum

In order to bridge the other way, follow the same steps, but select "Arbitrum" as your "From" network. Ensure the token you are exchanging "From" and "To" are both ETH (unless you know what you are doing).

_if you just bridged mainnet ETH to Arbitrum to start farming, you can now [start farming](../contrax-dapp/farm) in just a few clicks!_
