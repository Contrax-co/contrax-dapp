## Overview

This is the main tool of Contrax: our auto-compounding farms. You can grow your crypto positions in a few simple steps.

## Farms

At beta, Contrax has Plutux and GMX as the real yield projects we encourage people to farm in. We also have USDC and USDT stablecoin farms (stablecoins are 1:1 exchangeable for USD), and several WETH (wrapped ETH, 1:1 exchangeable for ETH) - stablecoin farms, and WETH-Bitcoin.

For each farm, the first column will show your deposited amount (blank if undeposited). The second column shows the total liquidity of the pool, and the third shows the APY, or the approximate yearly percentage growth from staking in the farm.

For the TVL APY, you can, hover over the "i" to see the breakdown of where the liquidity is, and where your yield is coming from.

When you open a farm, and then click "see more details," this is the farm information you will see:

There is a toggle to switch between deposit and withdraw, which start on deposit by default.

You can see you the balance you can deposit and withdraw, and click "max" to default it to the max, or type in a custom amount if prefer.

You can click "See more details" the price of each asset, your unstaked position (available for deposit) and your staked position (available for withdrawal).

## How to join a farm

1. Ensure you the tokens you need. Some farms need a single sided token like GMX, USDC, or USDT. You can get them with ETH from the [Exchange page](../contrax-dapp/exchange). All other farms can be entered with just ETH, so there's no need to exchange anything.
2. Find the farm you want to join, and click it open it. If you won the token type for the farm, you will see a balance in USD value. You can click "USD" to select the deposit token to type in the actual token amount if you prefer.

3. Click "Max" (or type an amount) and then "Deposit," and then confirm the transactions that pop up in MetaMask. Note that they may be one or more depending on the farm and deposit method.

4. After depositing, you'll see a depositing confirmation in the corner of your screen that will say "deposited" when the
transaction completes.

You are now earning a yield on your LP token! To see your position, go the "dashboard" page. Note that it may take a few seconds and a refresh to bring it up.

## How to withdraw from a farm

To withdraw, click the farm your have a position in, simply do the reverse process:

1.  Click the farm to open it, and click "withdraw" next to "deposit"

2.  Click "Max" and then "Withdraw" to withdraw all your available tokens, and then confirm the transactions that pop up in MetaMask.

If it a single-sided farm, you'll see that token in your wallet, and you can swap it for ETH or another asset on the exchange page. If it was an LP farm, you can withdraw with "Zap ETH" and get your tokens as ETH. If you wish, you can use the [bridge guide](../start/bridge) to take the ETH back to Ethereum mainnet.
