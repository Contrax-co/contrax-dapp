## Overview

The Contrax farms are where you can stake your ETH or other tokens for rewards in a few clicks.

## About Farms

Farming means exchanging your crypto into the one or two tokens of the liquidity pool in order to provide liquidity for trades.

Your crypto will essentially be the the tokens listed in the farm. For example, if you zap your ETH into the dual WETH-USDC farm, your holdings will be similar to 50% ETH and 50% USDC.
For providing liquidity, you earn an APY (annual percentage yield) on your holdings. The APY is not set by us and may vary over time. Contrax combines all your rewards back into the farm token for maximum rewards.

Users can enter and exit almost all farms with just ETH thanks to our zapping contracts. Advanced users can enter and exit with the single token or the LP token if they wish.

## How to join a farm

1. When you go to farms, this is what you'll see. There is an APY column which shows the yearly increase at the current reward rate, the deposited amount if any, and the earned amount (coming soon).
   Note that you can switch between single and dual tokens with the toggle at the top.
