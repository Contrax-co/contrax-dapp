## Overview

This is the main tool of Contrax: our auto-compounding farms, real yield farms. You can grow your crypto positions in a few simple steps.

## Farms

At beta, Contrax has GMX as the real yield project we encourage people to farm in. Besides with, we have several WETH farms (wrapped ETH, 1:1 exchangeable for ETH) with stablecoins (1:1 tradeable for USD), and Bitcoin.

Here are the starting farms:

<Frame>![Farms](/images/farms.png)</Frame>

For each farm, the first and second columns will show your deposited amount and what percent of the pool you own on Contrax (blank if undeposited). The third column shows the total liquidity of the pool, and the fourth shows the APY, or the approximate yearly percentage growth from staking in the farm.

For the APY, you can, hover over the "i" to see the breakdown of where your yield is coming from.

When you open a farm, and then click "see more details," this is the farm information you will see:

There is a toggle to switch between deposit and withdraw, which start on deposit by default.

You can see you the balance you can deposit and withdraw, and click "max" to default it to the max, or type in a custom amount if prefer.

Click "See more details" the price of each asset, your unstaked position (available for deposit) and your staked position (available for withdrawal).

## How to join a farm

1. Ensure you either have GMX of the LP token you need. See the [Zap in page](../contrax-dap/zap-in-trade) to exchange your ETH for the right LP or GMX.
2. Find the farm you want to join, and click it. Picking up for our swap example, we will enter the WETH-USDC farm:

3. Click "Max" and then "Deposit" to deposit all your available LP tokens, and then confirm the two transactions that pop up in MetaMask.

Note that that for some reason the gas estimate provided may be too high. Both transactions will actually be about 3-5 cents in gas, but the estimation may say over $1. This is incorrect, and after you deposit, you can see yourself in your MetaMask history what the actual cost was.

4. After depositing, you'll see a depositing modal in the corner of your screen that
will become "deposited" when the transaction completes.

You are now earning a yield on your LP token! To see your position, go the "dashboard" page. Note that it may take a few seconds and a refresh to bring it up.

## How to withdraw from a farm

To withdraw, click the farm your have a position in, simply do the reverse process:

1.  Click the farm to open it, and click "withdraw" next to "deposit"

2.  Click "Max" and then "Withdraw" to withdraw all your available LP tokens, and then confirm the two transactions that pop up in MetaMask.

Once confirmed, your LP tokens will back in your wallet. Refresh the page and you can see the LP balance available to be deposited again. You can then go the exchange page and swap the LP tokens for any asset in the list, including Arbitrum ETH, and then use the [bridge guide](../start/bridge) to take them back to Ethereum mainnet if you prefer.
