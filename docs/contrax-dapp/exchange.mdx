On this page, you can buy Ethereum for farming directly via Ramp, bridge your mainnet Ethereum to Arbitrum for farming via Socket, or swap to different tokens for single sided farms via Uniswap.

## Buy

Contrax uses Ramp, a licensed and regulated third party service, to let you buy Ethereum on Arbitrum for Contrax farming. Per money exchange guidelines, you will have to provide identity information to Ramp, which Contrax cannot see or access at all.

1. Make sure you connect/create your wallet by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner of the page. See [Wallet set-up](../start/wallet-setup) for more details.

## Swap

1. Ensure you have Arbitrum ETH or another token supported by exchange.
2. Type you can type in the amount you want to swap (like 0.01 in the exmaple).
3. Once your amount auto-fills, click "See Details" and the following screen will show:
    <Frame>![Swap Details](/images/swap_details.png)</Frame>
4. If you are satisfied with the swap and USD values, click "Accept." You will then have to approve the swap in your wallet.
5. After a few seconds, you'll see a "Success" message. Click "Close" if you want to do another swap.

_You can now join a farm with the token. Head over the Farms page, which you can learn how to use [here](../contrax-dapp/farms)._
