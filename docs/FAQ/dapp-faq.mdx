## What Stage is Contrax in?

Contrax is currently in its beta phase. Its live right now for you to [use right now](https://beta.contrax.finance). Keep in mind that the app is newly released, and although forked from audited code, it is no longer considered audited given our changes, and comes with risk. Any use of it at this time is us to get feedback from users to improve it for the full release.

## How do I use Contrax?

We have created our "Getting Started" pages for newcomers. You can read about the [Basics of DeFi](../start/defi). If want to start from the first instruction, go to the [Wallet Set-up](../start/wallet-setup) guide. Go to the guide on the [Arbitrum Bridge](../start/bridge) if you have mainnet ETH but need it on Arbitrum, and finally our [Quick start Farming](../start/quickstart) guide to enter your first farm.

## Is Contrax safe to use?

Unlike the traditional tech companies who say: "yes, trust us!" we say: "Yes, because you don't have to trust us!" Unlike a centralized exchange, the point of a dApp is to be open source with all tokens in your control at all times. In a true dApp, even if the team goes rogue, or gets hacked, or the website goes offline, it will always be possible to get your funds from the smart contract they are in.

## How do I get my funds out of Contrax?

We understand many have been burned by centralized exchange. As a decentralized app Contrax, never custodies your funds, and you can always withdraw from our farms. It is impossible for us to stop withdrawals, even if we took the site down. The farming guide includes withdrawal instructions, and it will always be possible to take your funds from the smart contract directly, even without our site or support.

## How do I give feedback to the team?

Okay, this isn't really a FAQ, but we really do want you to reach out and share your beta experience! You can reach us by any of our social media channels, with our preference being our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rDdvyeWAtt).
