## What Stage is Contrax in?

Contrax is currently in its beta phase. Its live right now for you to [use right now](https://beta.contrax.finance). Keep in mind that the app is newly released, and although forked from audited code, it is no longer considered audited given our changes, and comes with risk. Any use of it at this time is us to get feedback from users to improve it for the full release.

Here is the terms and conditions

## Where do I start to learn how to use Contrax?

We have created our "Getting Started" pages for newcomers. You can read about the [Basics of DeFi](../start/defi) if you want, or you can just go to [Wallet Set-up](../start/wallet-setup) if you are new to using wallets or Arbitrum, [Arbitrum Bridge](../start/bridge) if you have mainnet ETH but need it on Arbitrum, and finally our [Quick start Farming](../start/quickstart) guide to enter your first farm.

## Is Contrax safe to use?

Unlike the traditional tech companies who say: "yes, trust us!" we say: "Yes, because you don't have to trust us!" Unlike a centralized exchange, the point of a dApp is to be open source with all tokens in your control at all times. In a true dApp, even if the team goes rogue, or gets hacked, or the website goes offline, it will always be possible to get your funds from the smart contract they are in.
