This page is for users who have created a wallet per the [wallet quick-start guide](../start/wallet-setup) and have ETH somewhere else they want to move to Contrax.

If you do not have ETH at all, read our [Buying guide](../start/buy) to see how to buy ETH within the Contrax dApp.

## Wallet Address Overview

Your MetaMask wallet is your wallet to put the crypto you wish to spend or store. It has a public address so that you or anyone else can identify it to send it funds. To get your address, just copy it to the clipboard by clicking it here:

Once it is copied, you can paste it wherever you are asked to transfer or withdraw Ethereum to an external address.

## Difference Between Mainnet ETH and Arbitrum ETH

Before continuing, it is important to ensure you understand Arbitrum and Layer 2s:

The Ethereum and ETH you are familiar with are mainnet Ethereum, a layer 1 blockchain. Layer 2s have their own ETH, including Arbitrum. This ETH is the same as mainnet in value, but just a diffrent form.

Think of the difference between a dollars in your bank account vs. dollars on an exchange or a stock trading site. They are both USD, but there's a process to move between them. The same with ETH and AETH.

The good news is that the address your mainnet and Arbitrum wallets are exactly the same. You can just have to "choose network" in MetaMask to see the ETH on that network.

## How to Transfer ETH to MetaMask from Anywhere

To use Contrax, you need Arbitrum Ether. You can obtain it a few ways, but in all cases, you will need to know how to transfer ETH.

Transferring ETH is simple. If you have ETH somewhere (Coinbase, Crypto.com, another exchange, a local wallet, etc.), all you have to do is find the option to "Withdraw" your ETH, and for the address, provided the one you copies from your MetaMask.
You will need to wait a few minutes, and you will pay a few dollars in gas fees, and maybe a few more if the platform is a centralized exchange that wants a cut (another reason to prefer DeFi platforms like Contrax).

You may notice an option to "Select your network." If you are able to select Arbitrum, then select it, and the exchange will send the ETH to the Arbitrum Network in your MetaMask, and you are good to go to our [Quckstart Guide](../start/quickstart) and start farming.

If not, then you are withdrawing mainnet Ethereum, and you will have bridge it to Arbitrum. Its just a few more quick steps explained over at our [Bridging guide](../start/bridge).

_Now that your wallet has Arbitrum ETH, you are [ready to start farming](../contrax-dapp/farms)_
