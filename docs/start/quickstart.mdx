## Wallet Set-up

Before you can use this guide to farm, you must have Arbitrum ETH in your MetaMask wallet. See our other start guides if you do not.

## Decide Which Farm(s) you want to join

Go to the farms page and see the different farms offered. When deciding what farms to join, don't just look at the APY. Consider the underlying assets and how the values can change. Ater all, your LP token represents both the underlying assets.

Currently most farms are against a stablecoin, so at least one side should not change in value. When an asset changes value, your staking is subject to impermanent loss, which you can learn more about in [this article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-impermanent-loss-9ac6795e5baa).

Note that the GMX farm stakes GMX and not an LP token, so you can just swap into GMX.

## Swapping your ETH for an LP token

1. Go the to the Zap-in & Trade page on the [Contrax dApp](https://beta.contrax.finance/).

2. Select ETH on the top (or if you have another Arbitrum asset from the list, you can start from there as well)

3. Select the LP token you want to farm

4. Enter the amount of ETH you want to swap

5. Click "See Details" to review the transaction.

6. Click "Confirm" and then approve the transaction in your wallet.

If you want a more detailed breakdown on how to exchange, see [the Zap-in docs page](../contrax-dapp/zap-in-trade).

## Staking your LP token

1. Go to the farms page

2. Select the farm you want, for example: WETH-DAI farm

3. Click it to open it, click "Max" and then click deposit.

4. Approve the two transactions in metamask.

That's it. You now earning an auto-compounded yield!

If you need a more detailed breakdown on how to farm, see [the Farms docs page](../contrax-dapp/farms).

You can view your positions in the dashboard, along with the expected yield. When you are ready to withdraw, click just "Withdraw" and approve the two transactions in metamask.
Then, you can go to the Zap in & Trade page and swap the now larger LP token share into Arbitrum ETH or any other asset you prefer. You can also bridge it back to mainnet Ethereum using Hop Network or any other bridge.
