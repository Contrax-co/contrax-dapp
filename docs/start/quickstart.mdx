## Wallet Set-up

Before you can use this guide to farm, you must have Arbitrum ETH in your MetaMask wallet. See our other start guides if you do not.

## Decide Which Farm(s) you want to join

Go to the farms page and see the different farms offered. When deciding what farms to join, don't just look at the APY. Consider the underlying assets and how the values can change. Ater all, your LP token represents both the underlying assets.

Currently most farms are against a stablecoin, so at least one side should not change in value. When an asset changes value, your staking is subject to impermanent loss, which you can learn more about in [this article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-impermanent-loss-9ac6795e5baa).

Note that the GMX farm stakes GMX and not an LP token, so you can just swap into GMX.

## Only For USDT, USDC, and GMX: Swapping your ETH for a singe sided token

1. Go the to the Exchange page on the [Contrax dApp](https://beta.contrax.finance/).

2. Select ETH on the top (or if you have another Arbitrum asset from the list, you can start from there as well)

3. Select the token you want to farm. You do NOT need to do this for LP tokens (ex: WETH-DAI) if you have ETH, but can if you want

4. Enter the amount of ETH you want to swap.

5. Click "See Details" to review the transaction.

6. Click "Confirm" and then approve the transaction in your wallet.

If you want a more detailed breakdown on how to swap, see [the Exchange docs page](../contrax-dapp/exchange).

## Staking your LP token

1. Go to the farms page

2. Select the farm you want. If its USDT, USDC, or GMX, ensure you have the tokens. If its any other farm, having just ETH is fine.

3. Click it to open your farm, click "Max" (or type your desired deposit amount), and then click deposit.

4. Approve the the transaction in MetaMask. It may be one or more approvals.

That's it. You now in a farm, earning an auto-compounded yield!

If you need a more detailed breakdown on how to farm, see [the Farms docs page](../contrax-dapp/farms).

You can view your positions in the dashboard, along with the expected yield. When you are ready to withdraw, click just "Withdraw" and approve the transactions in metamask.
You can withdraw directly into ETH and you are done. If you prefer, you can switch the toggle from "ETH" to the LP token to withdraw into the LP, but you will need to then swap it in the exchange page for the asset you prefer.
Once in ETH, you also have the option to use the bridge again to go back to mainnet Ethereum.
