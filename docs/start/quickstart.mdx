## Wallet Set-up

To farm, all you need is a wallet with Arbitrum ETH. With Contrax, you can easily [set up a wallet](../start/wallet-setup) with just a social account like Google or Facebook.

Once your wallet is ready, all you have do is make sure you have Arbitrum ETH (which is just ETH on a more effecient network). You can do this by:

1. [Buying it](../contrax-dapp/buy) from our exchange page using our partner, Ramp.
2. [Transferring it](../transfer/general) from another site like Coinbase, Binance, Crypto.com, Kraken, or others. We have guides for each one.

## Select the farm you want to join

Contrax offers single token or dual token farms with varying APYs. Read our [disclaimers page](../info/disclaimers) for important disclaimers regarding the farms and their returns.

Note that, currently, only the ETH farm on the single sided token can be joined right away. All dual tokens can be joined with just ETH. For any other single sided,
you will need to [swap](../contrax-dapp/swap) your ETH for the token you want to farm.

## Depositing into a farm

Once you have a connect wallet with ETH:

1. Go to the farms page

2. Select the farm you want. You can select farms where your asset is a single or dual token.

3. Click the farm to open it, then click "Max" (or type your desired deposit amount), and then click "Deposit".

That's it! Once you see your confirmation, you now in a farm, earning your yield.

If want a more detailed guide with screenshots, see [the Farms page](../contrax-dapp/farms).

You can view your positions in the [dashboard](../contrax-dapp/dashboard), along with the expected yield.

## Exiting a farm

When you are ready to withdraw, click just "Withdraw," enter your amount or click "Max," and click the withdraw button.

You take your ETH and enter a new farm, withdraw it from the dashboard, or sell it via the exchange widget.
