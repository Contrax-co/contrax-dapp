In Web 3, a wallet where your crypto is stored. Some crypto exchanges control your wallet. True DeFi apps like Contrax do not have access to your wallet or funds. Only you do.

Thanks to Web3Auth, your wallet can be your account with with Google, Discord, Facebook, or GitHub.

## Alternatively: Using MetaMask or Other Wallets

MetaMask and other wallets are also supported by Contrax. The main difference is that your MetaMask wallet can connect to any other web3 app as well, while your Social sign-in is limited to the Contrax dApp. You will also have an extra security with manual approvals required for each transaciton.

If select MetaMask after "Connect Wallet," you will be prompted to download MetaMask for your browser if you don't have it. You will also need to add Arbitrum to MetaMask for the farms.
