## What is Metamask?

Traditional Web 2 apps have you log into their site where they store your data, balances, etc. With Web3, you control your own funds with your own wallet, but you can connect the wallet to Web3 apps (like Contrax) and then "approve" transactions for any funds to move.

MetaMask is a free Web3 wallet that provides you with a 20 word "seed phrase" which is the actual password (or key) to your wallet. The phrase is not seen by Metamask or your browser. As long as you have this phrase and do not share it with anyone, only you have control over your tokens.

## What is Arbitrum?

Mainnet Ethereum is a well-known blockchain for smart contracts and DeFi, but it is plagued by high gas fees. Chains on top of Ethereum solve this problem (known as Layer 2s) by batching transactions and submitting them at once on mainnet.

The most popular layer 2 that uses Ethereum's security is Arbitrum. It allows for significantly lower gas fees (cents instead of dollars) which then allows for a greater rate of auto-compounding for farms.

## Setting up MetaMask with Arbitrum

In order to use Contrax, you must use MetaMask and have ETH on Arbitrum. The following steps explains how to download and set up MetaMask with Ethereum, and how to move your Ethereum from mainnet to Arbitrum.

### MetaMask Set-up

1. Download the metamask extension for your browser. The easiest way is to follow the instructions from the official [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/download/).

2. Once downloaded, follow the prompts to get your seed phrase, and set your password.

3. Note your MetaMask Address.

You transfer Ethereum assets (ETH and ERC-20 tokens) by sending them to this address, and you'll then see them in your wallet. Note that this address stays the same for all networks, including Arbitrum.

### Add the Arbitrum Network to MetaMask

1. Open your MetaMask and click "Ethereum Network"
