## What is a Wallet?

In Web 3, a wallet is where your crypto is stored. Usually, crypto exchanges like Coinbase or Binance control your wallet. True DeFi apps like Contrax do not have access to your wallet or funds. Only you do.

Using Web3Auth, all you need to set up your wallet is just to sign in with Google, Discord, Facebook, or GitHub. You can also use another Web3 wallet if you prefer.

## How to Create a Social Wallet

1. Click "Connect Wallet" on the top right of the page.

2. Select your social network of choice and log in. The act of signing in creates your wallet if it doesn't already exist.

3. After sign in, in the top right corner, you will now see your network as "Arbitrum One" and your wallet with 0 ETH.

Youe wallet is now set up. All you need to do now is move ETH to it from your platform of choice. Just go to our [Wallet Funding](/farms) page and click "Connect Wallet" to get started.

## Alternatively: Using MetaMask or Other Wallets

MetaMask and other wallets are also supported by Contrax. The main difference is that your MetaMask wallet can connect to any other web3 app as well, while your Social sign-in is limited to the Contrax dApp. You will also have an extra security with manual approvals required for each transaciton.

If select MetaMask after "Connect Wallet," you will be prompted to download MetaMask for your browser if you don't have it. You will also need to add Arbitrum to MetaMask for the farms.
