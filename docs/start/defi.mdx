## DeFi & Smart Contracts

Blockchain has made it possible to transfer value outside of the centralized finance with assets known as tokens. Smart contracts give the ability to execute agreements for these tokens, and trade them without a third party via a DEX (Decentralized Exchange). These capabilities have led to the creation of DeFi (Decentralized Finance).

## Web3 and DApps

Web3 refers to applications built on top of blockchain technology. A dApp (Decentralized App) is a Web3 application which can run independently of any organization, including its creators. This is possible because the dApp connects directly to smart contracts which are controlled by the token owners, not the app creators.

## Wallets & Gas

Wallets refer to the applications or browser extentions where you hold your crypto, like MetaMask. These wallets can connect to multiple dApps and ensure that for every one, you bring your own funds and the platform only has access to whatever you allow it to. In order to make any transaction, some of your ETH will be spent to pay for the cost of transfer, so always make sure you have extra ETH in your wallet!

## Arbitrum & Layer 2s

Gas costs a few dollars on the Ethereum mainnet, and a few cents on Arbitrum and other layer 2s. For this reason, many DeFi projects are on a layer other than the main Ethereum that most people know. These layer 2s always save their transactions back to the main layer. It basically is a way to many transactions together to save gas cost. To learn how to move your ETH to Arbitrum, see our [Bridging guide](../start/bridge).

## Liquidity Pools & LP Tokens

A DEX allows the exchange of two tokens, but it needs a pre-existing pool with both tokens to provide liquidity for the exchange. If you provide these tokens for the pool, you get an _LP token_ as a receipt to claim your tokens back at any time. That LP token can earn rewards in fees and other rewards from external projects. Note that on Contrax, you don't have to worry about getting LP tokens as our farms auto-convert your ETH into the tokens, but it is good for you to understand what is actually happening.

## Farms & Zaps

The LP token is a receipt to show you provided liquidity, but to earn rewards on it, you need to stake it in a farm. Contrax has zaps to make it easy to swap from ETH (or other tokens) straight into the farming LP token, which can then be deposited into a farm. See the [Exchange page](../contrax-dapp/exchange) for details on how to obtain LP tokens.

## Real Yield

Some farms provide rewards for tokens that have no actual utility or value. Even tokens that do have utlity may inflate their token to provide rewards, therefore diluting everyone and not really providing rewards at all. Contrax will only list farms that pay out real value tokens, and pay rewards from the actual revenue earned by token's project.

## Auto-compounding

Each farms pays rewards in various tokens, leaving you with a hard-to-manage portfolio of reward tokens you know little about. Contrax uses autocompounding vaults to convert all rewards tokens into the same LP token being farmed which then increases your share of the pool, and therefore your rewards. The LPs can easily be swapped in ETH or any other major asset whenever you want.
