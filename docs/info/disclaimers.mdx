## Terms of Service

To use Contrax, you must be over eighteen, outside of OFAC restricted countries, and agree to our [Terms of Service](), a requirement to connect any wallet to Contrax.

We understand terms can be heavy, and we genuinely want you to be as informed as possible when farming on Contrax, so this page will provide a summary of the major risks of the Contrax platform.

## Smart contract risks

The most common way DeFi protocols suffer loss of funds is because of smart contract vulnerabilities that leads to the draining of crypto assets from the contracts.
Contrax is in beta and has yet to conduct a security audit of our smart contracts. Our reasonable confidence is based on the fact that the vast majority of our contract code being forked from larger products which have
been live for years and have conduced multiple audits. We strive to keep alterations to the smart contract logic to a minimal. Contrax has also open sourced our checking of smart contracts, with our currently live bug bounty
program live on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/contrax/).

## APY disclaimer

The APY refers to the growth of your LP position, independent of the price of the underlying asset. So if, for example, You stake a single sided asset like ETH with an APY of 15%, then if the APY is accurate, you will have 15% more ETH after one year,
with just over 1% increase every month. However, the APY itself is an estimate based on the trading fees as well as the incentives the platform gives to liquidity providers.

Both the amount and price of these two will change over time, and the APY will itself will be frequently updating based on these changes. The APY should be considered a snapshot estimation that other platforms provide. Contrax shares this estimate and updates it whenever you visit the platform. We do not set APYs not can guarantee their accuracies.

## Wallet and Custody disclaimer

Contrax is a non-custodial platform. This means that our team can never access your cryptocurrency by architectural design. We are simply an interface tool on top of smart contracts which only allow you to handle your tokens.
Contrax also does not provide the wallet services that hold the funds to deposit and withdraw into the farms. You can either connect their own Web3 wallet, or use
open source external Web3Auth tool to use a social media account to create a wallet. Your key is then tied to that social account. You can transfer your crypto from the dashboard, or export your private key to move their wallet elsewhere if you are
capable enough to do this.

Contrax encourages you to prefer using a Web3 wallet like MetaMask and research how to protect your seed phrase and private key. These wallets will actually require you to confirm every transaction before it is performed.  
If you do prefer using Web3Auth for its convenience, then ensure you secure whichever social account is tied to your wallet with two factor authentication.
Simply put, whoever can access that account can access your crypto, including any Contrax farm positions.

## Impermanent loss risks

For dual tokens, as one token price changes against another, there is a loss in value that happens to the liquidity provider due to arbitrage. This is called impermanent loss, and will lead some of the value of the provided
tokens being lost based on these price changes. We encourage you to research and fully understand impermanent loss before depositing into dual sided pools.

## Price risks

As a liquidity provider for a pool, your LP position is comparable to holding the actual token or tokens you are providing liquidity for.
Therefore, the value of your LP position is subject to the extremely volatile price changes the crypto market is known for.

## De-peg risks

Contrax offers several stablecoin liquidity pools, including dual token pools. If the value of these stablecoins stay exactly pegged to their assets, then your LP position will not suffer
from impermanent loss or price fluctuations. However, if in an event where the stablecoin de-pegs from its asset, there can be extreme loss caused by price and impermanent loss risks.
Please research stablecoins and the risks of de-pegging before participating in any stablecoin farm.

## Blockchain and Cryptocurrency risks

Blockchain and Cryptocurrency are both relatively new, and although the Contrax team believes in the technology, it carries serious risks weather it is used as a utility, artwork, or investment.
Please do your own research on blockchain and related technologies before using Contrax.

## Service fees

Contrax is currently in beta and has not finalized our fee model. Currently, Contrax collects 10% of the auto-compounded APY, which is a fraction of the total APY.
