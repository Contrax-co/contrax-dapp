## Create your Contrax Wallet

Before transferring, you need a wallet on Contrax to recieve your ETH.

Follow the quick guide on [creating a Contrax wallet](../start/wallet-setup), unless you already have a preferred Web3 wallet extention like MetaMask. If so, you can connect it via "Connect Wallet." Try "Wallet Connect" if you do not see it.

## Transfer from Coinbase to Contrax

1. If you do not have your assets in ETH, convert to it using the "convert" tab.

   To get your wallet address, copy it as explained [here](../start/wallet-setup) when you created your wallet.
   then click "Continue."
