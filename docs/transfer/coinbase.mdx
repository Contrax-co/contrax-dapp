## Create your Contrax Wallet

Before transferring, you need a wallet on Contrax to recieve your ETH.

Follow the quick guide on [creating a Contrax wallet](../start/wallet-setup), unless you already have a preferred Web3 wallet extention like MetaMask. If so, you can connect it via "Connect Wallet." Try "Wallet Connect" if you do not see it.

## Transfer from Coinbase to Contrax

1. If you do not have your assets in ETH, convert to it using the "convert" tab.

2. In the "send" tab, choose "Ethereum" as your asset. For "To", paste in your wallet address.
   To get your wallet address, copy it as explained [here](../start/wallet-setup) when you created your wallet.
   then click "Continue."

3. Be sure that you select "Arbitrum" as your network.
   Note: If you do not see "Arbitrum" as a network choice, you will have to select "Ethereum" and then do a few extra steps on Contrax to farm.

5. That's it! Your ETH will be sent to your Contrax wallet. Give it about a minute, and then check your dashboard.
   Be sure to log into Contrax with the same account you copied the address from. You will see your funds on the dashboard.
   If you had to send with "Ethereum" instead of "Arbitrum," you can bridge it in just a few clicks using our [bridge](../contrax-dapp/bridge) guide.

_Now that your wallet is funded, you are just three clicks away from [entering your first farm](../contrax-dapp/farms)._
