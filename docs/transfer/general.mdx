## Prerequisite

Before doing this guide, follow the quick guide on [creating a Contrax wallet](../contrax-dapp/buy), unless you already have your own web3 wallet of choice.

Note that is you do have a Web3 wallet, you do not need this guide, and you should see it when you click "Connect Wallet" and then Wallet Connect.

## Choose your platform

If your ETH is on any of these platforms, follow these guides for how to transfer your funds over.

## For All other Exchanges

For any other exchange, you can look up how to transfer ETH out of that exchange. The general steps will always be:

1. Find your ETH on your exchange
2. Find the option to "withdraw" your ETH.
3. If you are able to select network, select "Arbitrum." If not, it should default to mainnet Ethereum, which is fine too.
4. On Contrax, create wallet if you don't have one (guide [here](../start/wallet-setup)), and copy the address by clicking the address, then "Copy Address."
5. Paste the address into the "to" field on your exchange, and send the funds.

You will then see your funds on Contrax. If you could send it on Arbitrum, you are ready to farm. Just see our Quick-Start guide [here](../start/quick-start).

If you could only send it to mainnet, just bridge them with this guide [here](../contrax-dapp/bridge).
