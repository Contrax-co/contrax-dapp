## Create your Contrax Wallet

Before transferring, you need a wallet on Contrax to recieve your ETH.

Follow the quick guide on [creating a Contrax wallet](../start/wallet-setup), unless you already have a preferred Web3 wallet extention like MetaMask. If so, you can connect it via "Connect Wallet." Try "Wallet Connect" if you do not see it.

## Transfer from Binance to Contrax

1. In The Binance withddraw screen for your spot wallet, select "ETH," and paste your wallet address.

To get your wallet address, copy it as explained [here](../start/wallet-setup) when you created your wallet.

Ensure you select "Arbitrum" as the network.

You can type in the amount you wish to send, or press "Max" to send your full ETH balance.

Then click "Continue."
