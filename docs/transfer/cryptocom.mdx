## Create your Contrax Wallet

Before transferring, you need a wallet on Contrax to recieve your ETH.

Follow the quick guide on [creating a Contrax wallet](../start/wallet-setup), unless you already have a preferred Web3 wallet extention like MetaMask. If so, you can connect it via "Connect Wallet." Try "Wallet Connect" if you do not see it.

## Transfer from Crypto.com to Contrax

1. Tap "transfer ETH" and then click "Withdraw," and then "External Wallet Address."

4. For "Wallet Address Details," be sure you tap "Arbitrum" for network, and then paste your Contrax wallet address.

To get your wallet address, copy it as explained [here](../start/wallet-setup) when you created your wallet.

Give your wallet a meaningful name, like "Contrax," and then tap "Continue."

Note: You may be asked to set-up two factor authentication before you can proceed. This should always be done on all crypto accounts for your security.

5. Tap your newly saved wallet address.

8. That's it! Your ETH will be sent to your Contrax wallet. Give it about a minute, and then check your dashboard.
   Be sure to log into Contrax with the same account you copied the address from. You will see your funds on the dashboard.
