## Create your Contrax Wallet

Before transferring, you need a wallet on Contrax to recieve your ETH.

Follow the quick guide on [creating a Contrax wallet](../start/wallet-setup), unless you already have a preferred Web3 wallet extention like MetaMask. If so, you can connect it via "Connect Wallet." Try "Wallet Connect" if you do not see it.

## Transfer from Crypto.com to Contrax

1. Tap "transfer ETH" and then click "Withdraw," and then "External Wallet Address."

To get your wallet address, copy it as explained [here](../start/wallet-setup) when you created your wallet.

Give your wallet a meaningful name, like "Contrax," and then tap "Continue."

Note: You may be asked to set-up two factor authentication before you can proceed. This should always be done on all crypto accounts for your security.

5. Tap your newly saved wallet address.
